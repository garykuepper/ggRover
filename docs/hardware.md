# ggRover — Hardware Specification Sheet

Source of truth for **what hardware exists, what it's rated for, and how it's configured**. Pair with [docs/pinouts.md](docs/pinouts.md) (the source of truth for *where each piece is wired*).

Two MCUs in this project — sections are split by host:

- **[Rover hardware](#rover-hardware)** — everything driven by the STM32 Blue Pill (motors, sensors, chassis, battery).
- **[Controller hardware](#controller-hardware)** — everything on/with the Pro Micro (gamepad, OLED, controller-side XBee).
- **[Inter-MCU link](#inter-mcu-link)** — the radio bridge between the two.
- **[Firmware ↔ spec discrepancies](#firmware--spec-discrepancies)** — rover-side only; controller firmware is locked.

When the firmware and this doc disagree on **rover** hardware, this doc wins. On the **controller** side the firmware is authoritative.

## Rover hardware

### Blue Pill microcontroller

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill |
| Clock | 72 MHz |
| Logic voltage | 3.3V |
| Encoder timers | 4× hardware (TIM1–TIM4) |
| PWM channels | 8 needed (4× motor + 4× servo) |
| I2C bus | 1× shared across all sensors |

### Drive Motors ×4

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | JGA25-370 |
| Voltage | 12V |
| No-load speed | 280 RPM (21.3:1 gearbox) |
| At-load speed | ~220 RPM |
| Stall current | 1.3A per motor |
| Output shaft | 4mm Ø with flat |
| Encoder type | AB Hall effect, 11 PPR |
| Encoder wires | 6-wire — M+, M−, VCC, GND, A, B |
| Counts per wheel rev | 11 × 4 × 21.3 = ~937 |
| Encoder voltage | 3.3V — Blue Pill direct ✓ |

### Motor Drivers ×4 — **open**

ESC/H-bridge choice not locked. Candidates and requirements:

| | |
|---|---|
| Required continuous current | ≥1.5 A per channel (1.15× motor stall) |
| Required supply | 14.4 V nominal, 16.8 V peak (4S battery direct) |
| Required logic | 3.3 V tolerant (Blue Pill direct, no level-shifter) |
| Candidate A | DRV8871 — 3.6 A, IN1/IN2 (PWM + direction, **8 GPIOs total**) |
| Candidate B | TB6612FNG dual — 1.2 A cont. (under-spec at stall), PWMA/AIN1/AIN2 per channel |
| Candidate C | Brushed micro-ESC (RC-style, 1-wire PWM) — simplest pin count but no regen braking |

> Pin budget impact: Candidate A doubles rover PWM/GPIO usage (4 → 8) and forces a TIM2 reshuffle (see [pinouts.md](pinouts.md)). Candidate C keeps the current 1-pin-per-motor scheme.

> `Wire.setWireTimeout(3000us, reset=true)` is mandatory — see [PS4Interface.cpp:27-30](controller-firmware/src/PS4Interface.cpp#L27-L30). Prevents a stuck SDA from hanging the USB CDC auto-reset path.

## Firmware ↔ spec discrepancies

Captured at the time this doc was written; remove rows as the firmware catches up.

**Controller firmware is locked-in (validated 2026-05-24)** — its hardware addresses and wiring are the source of truth. All discrepancies below are rover-side, to be resolved on the rover.

| Area | Spec says | Firmware does | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Drive output | 4 channels, control scheme depends on ESC choice | 1× `analogWrite` per wheel ([rover-firmware/src/Drivetrain.cpp:20-23](rover-firmware/src/Drivetrain.cpp#L20-L23)) — no reverse | **blocked on ESC selection.** If DRV8871 → rewrite for IN1/IN2 pairs + TIM2 reshuffle. If micro-ESC → current 1-PWM scheme is fine, just add direction calibration. |
| Servos | 4× steering, model TBD | no servo code at all | add `Steering` class; reserve 4 PWM pins |
| Per-motor current | INA226 ×4 at `0x40`–`0x43` | not initialized; not in `TelemetryPacket` | add driver + extend `TelemetryPacket` (protocol break — bump version) |
| Battery voltage | 14.4 V nominal / 16.8 V peak (4S4P confirmed) | hardcoded `12.6f` ([rover-firmware/src/main.cpp:66](rover-firmware/src/main.cpp#L66)) | wire ADC divider; update telemetry scale |
| Encoder CPR | 937 counts / wheel-rev | `getDistance()` placeholder `* 0.5f` ([rover-firmware/src/Odometry.cpp:26](rover-firmware/src/Odometry.cpp#L26)) | use real CPR + wheel circumference (75 mm Ø → ~235.6 mm/rev) |
| Logic 5 V rail | "buck converter needed — not yet sourced" | n/a | flagged in [Outstanding rover items](#outstanding-rover-items) — blocks bring-up |
| ToF / BME280 init | future scope (not baseline) | `Adafruit_VL53L0X` + `Adafruit_BME280` initialized & read every loop ([rover-firmware/src/main.cpp:25-26](rover-firmware/src/main.cpp#L25-L26)) | acceptable as forward-compat scaffolding; consider `#ifdef`-gating for v1 firmware footprint |
